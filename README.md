# E-Commerce

## Description
I made the back end of a e-commerce website. Knowing what is in stock what what products are being bought are important for buisnesses to know, and back end programming can be used for these purposes. Tags are useful too, as they can be used to find certain products and can be used as search terms on the client's side.

I learned the best practises for sequalize and how to write the PUT routes.
